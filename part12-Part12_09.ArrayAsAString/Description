Objective
---------
Create in the exercise base a method called public static String arrayAsString(int[][] array). It should create a string representation of the array it receives as the parameter and return it.

Brush up on using StringBuilder in part 10.3 before taking on this exercise. Below there are a few examples of how the method is expected to work.

int rows = 2;
int columns = 3;
int[][] matrix = new int[rows][columns];
matrix[0][1] = 5;
matrix[1][0] = 3;
matrix[1][2] = 7;
System.out.println(arrayAsString(matrix));

Sample output

307
