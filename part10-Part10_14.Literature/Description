Objective
---------
Write a program that reads user input for books and their age recommendations.

The program asks for new books until the user gives an empty String (only presses enter). After this, the program will print the number of books, their names, and their recommended ages.
Reading and printing the books

Implement the reading and printing the books first, the ordering of them doesn't matter yet.

Ordering books based on their age recommendation

Expand your program so, that the books are sorted based on their age recommendations when they are printed. If two (or more) books share the same age recommendations the order between them does not matter.
