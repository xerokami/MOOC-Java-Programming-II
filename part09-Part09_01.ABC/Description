Part1: Creating Classes
Create the following three classes:

    Class A. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void a(), which prints a string "A".
    Class B. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void b(), which prints a string "B".
    Class C. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void c(), which prints a string "C".


Part2 : Class inheritance
Modify the classes so that class B inherits class A, and class C inherits class B. In other words, class A will be a superclass for class B, and class B will be a superclass for class C.
