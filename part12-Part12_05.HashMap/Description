Objective
---------
Implement the class HashMap in the exercise base, following along the lines of the previous example. Unlike the example, implement the class so that it uses the ready-made Java class ArrayList in its internal implementation. There are no tests in the exercise base â€” test its functionality with the examples in the material, and with your own experimentation. This exercise is worth three points.
