Objective
---------
Your assignment is to complete the class LotteryRow, which is used to draw the week's winning numbers. The numbers are in range 1—40, and 7 numbers will be drawn in total. In other words, a lottery row consists of seven different numbers that are all in range 1—40.

We wish to implement the following functions in the class:

    the constructor LotteryRow creates a new LotteryRow object that contains new randomized numbers.

    the method numbers returns the drawn lottery numbers of this lottery row

    the method containsNumber tells whether the given number is included in the drawn numbers

    the method randomizeNumbers randomizes new numbers for the lottery row.

The basic structure of the class is as follows:

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

    public class LotteryRow {
    private ArrayList<Integer> numbers;

    public LotteryRow() {
        this.randomizeNumbers();
    }

    public ArrayList<Integer> numbers() {
        return this.numbers;
    }

    public boolean containsNumber(int number) {
        // Tests whether the number is already among the randomized numbers
        return false;
    }

    public void randomizeNumbers() {
        // initialize the list for numbers
        this.numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        // Implement the randomization of the numbers by using the method containsNumber() here
    }

    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return false;
    }
}

The following main program is supplied in the exercise base:

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LotteryRow row = new LotteryRow();
        ArrayList<Integer> lotteryNumbers = row.numbers();

        System.out.println("Lottery numbers:");
        for (int number: lotteryNumbers) {
            System.out.print(number + " ");
        }

        System.out.println("");
    }
}

Here are a few possible outputs of the program:
Sample output

Lottery numbers:
3 5 10 14 15 27 37
Sample output

Lottery numbers:
2 9 11 18 23 32 34
