UserInterface

There is a package called mooc included in the exercise. We will create the functionality of the program inside this package. Add the package ui inside the package mooc (after which the package mooc.ui should be available), and add an interface called UserInterface in it.

The interface UserInterface defines the method void update().
Text user interface

In the same package, create the class TextInterface that implements the UserInterface interface. Implement the method public void update(), required by the interface UserInterface, so that the only thing it does is print the string "Updating UI" by calling the method System.out.println.
Application logic

Then create the package mooc.logic. Create the class ApplicationLogic in it. The functionality that the application logic offers should be as follows:

    public ApplicationLogic(UserInterface ui)
    The constructor of the ApplicationLogic class. It receives as a parameter a class that implements the UserInterface interface. NB: For application logic to see the interface, it must be "imported". Add the line import mooc.ui.UserInterface at the beginning of the file.

    public void execute(int times)
    Prints the string "Application logic is working" the number of times that is indicated by the variable times. After each print, the method should call the update() method of the object that was received as a constructor parameter (which implements the UserInterface interface).
