Objective
---------
Modify the class, such that the constructor Die(int numberOfFaces) creates a new die-object with the given number of faces (i.e. the number of "sides" with a number). Also, modify the method throwDie so it returns the result of a random throw of the die, which should be a value withing the range 1 ... number of faces.

The following is a main program for testing the die:
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Die die = new Die(6);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(die.throwDie());
        }
    }
}
