Objective
---------
In this exercise we are going to create a program that can be used to create and modify a to-do list. The final product will work in the following manner.

Command: add
Task: go to the store
Command: add
Task: vacuum clean
Command: list
1: go to the store
2: vacuum clean
Command: completed
Which task was completed? 2
Task go to the store tehty
Command: list
1: go to the store
Command: add
Task: program
Command: list
1: go to the store
2: program
Command: stop

Part1: TodoList
Create a class called TodoList. It should have a constructor without parameters and the following methods:

    public void add(String task) - add the task passed as a parameter to the todo list.
    public void print() - prints the exercises. Each task has a number associated with it on the print statement â€” use the task's index here (+1).
    public void remove(int number) - removes the task associated with the given number; the number is the one seen associated with the task in the print.


Part2: User Interface
Next, implement a class called UserInterface. It should have a constructor with two parameters. The first parameter is an instance of the class TodoList, and the second is an instance of the class Scanner. In addition to the constructor, the class should have the method public void start() that is used to start the text user interface. The text UI works with an eternal looping statement (while-true), and it must offer the following commands to the user:

    The command stop stops the execution of the loop, after which the execution of the program advances out of the start method.
    The command add asks the user for the next task to be added. Once the user enters this task, it should be added to the to-do list.
    The command list prints all the tasks on the to-do list.
    The command remove asks the user to enter the id of the task to be removed. When this has been entered, the specified task should be removed from the list of tasks.
