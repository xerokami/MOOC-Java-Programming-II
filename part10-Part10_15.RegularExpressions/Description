---------
Day of week

Use regular expressions to create the method public boolean isDayOfWeek(String string), which returns true if the parameter string is an abbreviation of a day of the week (mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun)

Example outputs of a program that uses the method:
Sample output

Enter a string: tue
The form is correct.
Sample output

Anna merkkijono: abc
The form is incorrect.
Vowel check

NB. For simplicity's sake, in this exercises the letters that are considered vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.

Create the method public boolean allVowels(String string) that uses a regular expression to check whether all the characters in the parameter string are vowels.

Example outputs of a program that uses the method:
Sample output

Enter a string: oi
The form is correct.
Sample output

Enter a string: queue
The form is incorrect.
Time of day

Regular expressions come in handy in certain situations. In some cases the expressions become too complex, and the "correctness" of the string is best checked with some other style. Or it could be beneficial to use regular expressions for only some part of the check.

Create the method public boolean timeOfDay(String string). It should use a regular expression to check whether the parameter string expresses a time of day in the form hh:mm:ss (hours, minutes, and seconds each always take up two spaces).

NB. In this exercise we use the 24-hour clock. So the acceptable values are between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.

Example outputs of a program that uses the method:
Sample output

Enter a string: 17:23:05
The form is correct.
Sample output

Enter a string: abc
The form is incorrect.
Sample output

Enter a string: 33:33:33
The form is incorrect.
